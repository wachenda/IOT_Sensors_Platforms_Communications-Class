# NOTES for Assignment 4

## Overview:

For this assignment, you will be using a programming language (Python) to dynamically create a web page that displays your Pi’s sensor data whenever it is executed. Like assignment #1 & #3, your output screen will display basic weather‐ related information in a web page. This time, you will have to use your assignment #3’s HTML as a template. You will have to also include a current date‐time stamp whenever your Python code recreates your web page. For time sake, you can run your program from the command line to dynamically create your web page.
