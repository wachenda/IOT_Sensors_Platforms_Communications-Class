# NOTES for Assignment 7:

## Overview:

Write a program to control an I2C 16x2 LCD character display using  the Pi.  Have the program display your name.

## Details:

I used the [AdaFruit 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1115) that has an I2C interface on it for this assignment.

I also used the [AdaFruit_Python_CharLCD code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_CharLCD)  to interface to the display.
